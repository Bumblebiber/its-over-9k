# hmem-session-start

## TRIGGER
Run at the beginning of any session where a Cortex project is active.

## STEP 1: Activate project

Call load_project with the working project ID:

load_project(id: "P00XX")

Replace P00XX with the actual project ID (e.g., P0048).

load_project returns the project brief, recent O-Entry summaries, rules, and lessons.
Do NOT call read_memory separately. load_project is the only activation action.

## STEP 2: Noise Check

**Do this immediately after load_project, before any other work.**

Scan the output for:
- **>4k tokens** → invoke `hmem-curate` on this project first, then continue
- **✓ DONE items in Roadmap** → `update_memory(id, { irrelevant: true })`
- **Decommissioned / concept entries in Infrastructure** → `update_memory(id, { irrelevant: true })`
- **Old status snapshots in Overview** (superseded by newer) → mark obsolete
- **`[-]` prefix sections** (e.g. `P00XX.10 [-] Bugs`) — orphaned schema artifacts → `update_memory(id, { irrelevant: true })` for each
- **Duplicate L2 sections** (two nodes with same name) → mark the higher-numbered one irrelevant

Fix all of the above immediately. Do not note and defer.

## STEP 3: Calibrate explanation depth

Read H0003 (IT Skills) — the scale is 1–9:
- **7–9 = Expert**: use technical language directly, no padding, no basics
- **4–6 = Proficient**: explain concepts but skip fundamentals
- **1–3 = Basics**: explain with examples

Apply this calibration for the entire session. When explaining something in a domain, check the matching H0003 skill first.

## STEP 4: O-Entry routing check

**This step is critical.** Every `load_project` call changes which O-entry receives session exchanges. If you called `load_project` on any project other than your working project — even briefly, even for administrative reasons (reconcile, curation, migration) — those exchanges were misrouted to the wrong O-entry.

After activating, check for misrouted exchanges:

```
read_memory(id: "O00XX")   ← the working project's O-entry (same seq as P00XX)
```

Look at the most recent batch. If exchanges are missing that you know happened (e.g. earlier in this session), they landed in another project's O-entry.

**To find them:** check O-entries for any other project you called `load_project` on during this session. Look for nodes created today with content matching your session.

**To fix:**
```
move_nodes(node_ids: ["O00YY.Z"], target_o_id: "O00XX")
```

Move the misrouted session/batch node to the correct O-entry.

**Rule:** Never call `load_project` on a secondary project without immediately re-calling it on your working project. Routing follows the last `load_project` call — always return control explicitly.

## What gets injected automatically (first message)

The UserPromptSubmit hook injects the following into every session start:
- **H-entries** — top 10 by access count (ID + title)
- **Active device apps** — Apps list of the current I-entry (if device is set)
- **Infrastructure favorites** — any I-entry with `favorite: true` (e.g. reMarkable, shared server). Mark with `update_memory(id="I00XX", favorite=true)`.
- **Recent projects** — 5 most recently updated P-entries

## OUTPUT

After both steps, output exactly:

[CORTEX READY]
Project: <name from load_project>
Context loaded. Ready.
[/CORTEX READY]

Then wait for the user's first message.
