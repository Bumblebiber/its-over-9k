# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Hermes Agent statusline integration.** New `hmem-statusline.sh` hook script displays project, device, O-node (`→ O0048.118`), and checkpoint counter (`1/5`) in Hermes CLI's status bar — matching the Claude Code statusline format. The `o9k-startup.sh` hook now caches session ID for O-node resolution.

### Fixed
- **Hook `o9k-startup.sh` sync indicator never shown.** The pre-LLM hook computed a 🟢/🔴 sync dot but never included it in the injected context string. Also: `o9k-sync` binary doesn't exist — switched to `hmem sync status`; grep pattern `✓ Linked` didn't match actual `Online: yes` output.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-11

### Breaking Changes
- Package renamed from `hmem-mcp` to `its-over-9k` on npm
- GitHub repo renamed from `Bumblebiber/hmem` to `Bumblebiber/its-over-9k`
- `hmem-mcp` is now deprecated — migrate: `npm uninstall -g hmem-mcp && npm install -g its-over-9k`
- MCP config path update required (see README)

### What stays the same
- CLI binary names: `hmem`, `hmem-curate`
- All MCP tool names and signatures
- All existing memory files — no migration needed

## 7.4.1 — 2026-05-11

### Changed

- **Removed dead fallback code in `create_project`.** The hardcoded R0009 section list that ran when no schema was configured is gone — `DEFAULT_CONFIG.schemas.P` makes it unreachable. No behaviour change.
- **Skills updated:** `hmem-config`, `hmem-write`, `hmem-curate`, `hmem-wipe` — `"Protocol"` corrected to `"History"`, `"Open tasks"` updated to `"Roadmap"`.

## 7.4.0 — 2026-05-11

### Breaking changes

- **`syncSecrets` default flipped to `false`.** Sync configs that previously omitted `syncSecrets` were treating it as `true` and pushing tokens/salts to the sync server. After upgrading, secrets stay local unless the user explicitly sets `"syncSecrets": true` in `hmem.config.json`. Motivated by the 2026-05-05 credential-exposure incident; the safe default is now opt-in.

### Changed

- **Sync I/O no longer blocks the event loop.** `syncPull`, `syncPullThenPush`, `syncPushSync`, `syncPushWithRetry`, `reserveId`, `reserveNextId`, and `reserveNextSubIds` now return Promises and use `child_process.spawn` instead of `spawnSync`. MCP tool handlers `await` them, so behaviour is unchanged for callers — but a slow `hmem-sync` push no longer freezes the stdio transport for other work.

- **`HmemStore.db` marked `@internal`.** New public helpers — `isObsolete(id)`, `hasActiveEntryWithPrefix(prefix)`, `getNonObsoleteTitle(id)` — replace four raw `store.db.prepare(...)` queries in `mcp-server.ts`. The raw handle is still accessible for migration scripts but no application code should use it.

- **Migration tracking via `schema_version`.** The `MIGRATIONS` array of `ALTER TABLE` statements now records each successful migration in `schema_version` (`alter_vN`) and only retries the ones that haven't been applied. Real errors are logged instead of silently swallowed; idempotent "duplicate column" failures are recognised and marked as applied.

## 7.0.1 — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`title` + `body` params for `write_memory`, `update_memory`, `append_memory`** — explicit title/body split instead of blank-line convention. All three tools now accept `title` (root title) and `body` (drill-down text) as separate parameters alongside the legacy `content` string. `content` is now optional in `write_memory` and `append_memory`. `update_memory` can update body-only by passing only `body` (existing title is preserved). Legacy `content`-only calls continue to work unchanged.

- **`hmem-new-error` skill** — structured workflow for creating E-entries in hmem. Mirrors `hmem-new-project`. Ensures correct schema, status tags, and linking to affected project nodes.

### Fixed

- **E-entry Auto-Scaffold: silently drop invalid L2 nodes** — `write_memory` with `prefix="E"` no longer throws on schema violations. Instead, tab-indented body text that was accidentally parsed as L2 nodes is silently dropped, and the entry is created with its correct scaffolded sections. Other prefixes still throw on invalid L2 nodes.

## 7.0.0 — 2026-04-27

### Breaking Changes

- **Two-server split** — the daily-use server (`hmem`) now ships 11 tools only. The 11 maintenance/destructive tools (`update_many`, `reset_memory_cache`, `export_memory`, `import_memory`, `memory_stats`, `memory_health`, `tag_bulk`, `tag_rename`, `move_memory`, `rename_id`, `move_nodes`) have moved to a separate `hmem-curate` binary. Add `hmem-curate` to your `.mcp.json` and activate it only when running `/hmem-curate` or `/hmem-migrate-o`. See the upgrade steps in `/hmem-update`.

### Added

- **`read_project()` MCP tool** — load another project's context (Overview, Codebase titles, Usage, Context, Requirements titles, Roadmap titles) without activating it or routing exchanges to its O-entry. Intended for cross-project reference while working on a different project.

- **`set_active_device()` MCP tool** — registers the current machine's I-entry ID in `~/.hmem/active-device`. Called automatically on the first message of a new session if no device file exists.

- **Device tracking in statusline** — the statusline now shows the active device name (I-entry title) as the first segment, e.g. `Strato Server | P0048 hmem-mcp | …`. Shows `identify device` in gray if `set_active_device` has not been called yet. Create an I-entry for each machine, then call `set_active_device({ id: "I00XX" })` once per device.

- **Rate limits in statusline** — Claude Max subscribers see live 5-hour and weekly usage percentages: `5h: 34% / w: 17%`. Color-coded green/yellow/red. No configuration required — data comes from Claude Code automatically.

- **`hmem setup-hook` CLI command** — registers the `SessionStart` hook that injects the `hmem-using-hmem` meta-skill at every session start. Idempotent, safe to re-run.

- **hmem-using-hmem meta-skill** — session-start injection of dispatch and memory habits. Mirrors Superpowers' `using-superpowers` pattern. Teaches the agent when to use `hmem-dispatch`, `hmem-recall`, `hmem-write`, `hmem-new-project`, etc.

- **`checkpointPolicy` enforcement in `append_memory`** — schema sections can now carry `"checkpointPolicy": "readonly"` (no automated appends) or `"checkpointPolicy": "pointer"` (only `[E0124]`-style entry references allowed). Enforced for all callers, not just checkpoint agents.

- **Auto-scaffold from config schema** — `write_memory` now creates all defined schema sections as empty L2 nodes immediately on entry creation, for every prefix that has a schema in `hmem.config.json` (except `E`, which keeps its own scaffold logic). The response shows the full section list: `Schema: .1 Specs, .2 OS, …`.

- **load_project onboarding hints** — when no I-entries exist (or none are active), and when no A-entries exist, `load_project` now appends contextual hints pointing the agent to create infrastructure and app entries.

### Changed

- **`hmem-new-project` skill trigger sharpened** — the trigger description now more explicitly fires when a new project needs to be created, reducing missed activations in parallel sessions.

## 6.6.4 — 2026-04-23

### Added
- **`hmem delete <id>` CLI command** — removes a memory entry by ID with confirmation prompt.

## 6.6.3 — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Active-project footer on writes** — `write_memory`, `append_memory` and `update_memory` now append `Active project: P00XX …` to their response so the agent can re-anchor after context compression (GH #27).

## 6.6.2 — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Default P/E section conventions** in built-in schemas — `sections[].description` now ships with guidance for checkpoint subagents, reducing wrong-node placement.

## 6.6.1 — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Sub-node attribution in FTS search** — `read_memory` search results now surface which child node matched, not just the root.

## 6.6.0 — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Configurable `globalLoad` injections for `load_project`** — replaces the hardcoded `R + C#universal` block with a per-item list in `hmem.config.json` (`memory.globalLoad`). Each item picks `prefix`, `loadDepth` (1–3) and an optional `tagFilter`. Falls back to the old defaults when unset.
- **CI matrix** — GitHub Actions now runs `typecheck → build → test` on Ubuntu / Windows / macOS × Node 20 / 22.
- **E2E MCP smoke test** — spawns `dist/mcp-server.js` and exercises the wire protocol via a real stdio client.

### Fixed
- **Version drift** — MCP handshake and upgrade-check both read from `package.json` now (were `"2.2.0"` and `"2.5.3"` respectively).
- **Hook CLIs hang on TTY** — `hmem log-exchange`, `startup-hook` and `context-inject` bail out cleanly when stdin is a terminal instead of a pipe.
- **`updateSkills()` on Windows** — resolved bundle path via `new URL().pathname` which produced a bogus leading `/` on Windows; now uses `fileURLToPath()`.

## 6.5.3 — 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Windows compatibility** for OpenCode plugin and `hmem init` — path handling and postinstall edge cases on Windows runners.

## 6.5.2 — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Statusline shows wrong project after `/clear` or new session** — per-process active-project file resolution missed session boundary changes in some edge cases.

## 6.4.0 — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Bash-intermediary layer in statusline and PPID bridge** — when the shell wrapping `claude` adds an intermediate bash process, the PPID chain was off by one; now walks the process tree.
- **Per-process active-project file** for session-isolated statusline — replaces the previous global marker file.

## 6.3.3 — 2026-04-14

### Docs
- Note in `hmem-update` skill about stale-skill pruning behavior introduced in 6.3.2.

## 6.3.2 — 2026-04-14

### Changed
- **Token-efficiency cleanup** — MCP tool count 29 → 21 (-824 lines). Removed dead code for single-agent setups:
  - Agent-memory subsystem: `read_agent_memory`, `fix_agent_memory`, `append_agent_memory`, `delete_agent_memory`, `get_audit_queue`, `mark_audited`.
  - `route_task` (deprecated), `reorder_sessions` (covered by `move_nodes`).
- **`hmem_path` param** added to 4 core tools for foreign-file curation: `read_memory`, `update_memory`, `find_related`, `memory_health`. Sync and session cache skipped in external mode.
- **Unified `hmem-curate`** skill (merged `hmem-self-curate`) — one workflow covers self-curation and foreign-file curation.
- **`updateSkills` prunes stale `hmem-*` skills** that are no longer bundled.

### Added
- **OpenCode plugin** support (#19).
- **`claude-mcp` registry detection** in `hmem init` (#18).

### Fixed
- GitHub issues #11, #12, #14, #15, #16, #20, #21, #23.

## 6.3.1 — 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Refresh PPID bridge on every message**, not just the first — stale bridge files no longer mislead the MCP server.
- **Intelligent exchange filtering** in `load_project` — previous/current O-entry exchanges are compressed and filtered by relevance before injection.
- **Compress exchange text** in `load_project` output to keep the briefing budget.

## 6.3.0 — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Configurable per-prefix entry schemas** via `hmem.config.json` → `memory.schemas.*`. Each schema defines section order, per-section `loadDepth`, and optional `defaultChildren`.
- **Schema-driven `create_project` handler** — new P-entries use the schema from config.
- **Per-section `loadDepth`** in `load_project` rendering — each section controls how deep its children expand.
- **Auto-reconcile missing schema sections** on `load_project` — fills gaps without user action.
- **`hmem-wipe` marks completed Next Steps as irrelevant** — cleaner pre-`/clear` hygiene.

---

## 6.2.0 — 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Per-session active project state** — parallel Claude Code sessions no longer contaminate each other's active project. Each session now has its own marker file at `~/.hmem/sessions/<session_id>.json` and a PPID bridge file at `~/.hmem/sessions/ppid-<parent_pid>.json` so the MCP server can resolve session id without Claude Code env support. Fixes symptoms where exchanges were silently written to `O0000` or to a parallel session's O-entry.
- **Statusline cache** was global, causing two sessions to share the same cached project for 30 seconds. Now per-session.
- **Statusline no longer guesses** "most recently updated project" when nothing is active — shows `no project` instead.

### Added
- `~/.hmem/diagnostics.log` — JSONL log of every `log-exchange` call with active project resolution, rotated at 1 MB.
- Loud `console.error` warnings when log-exchange falls through to `O0000` or legacy DB flag.
- `src/session-state.ts` module with marker file R/W/purge and PPID bridge helpers.
- `src/diagnostics.ts` module with JSONL log writer and rotation.

### Deferred
- HMEM_PATH session anchor (CWD-discovery trap) — follow-up for users who start `claude` from project directories with `.hmem` files.
- Windows PPID bridge support — currently Linux/macOS only; Windows sessions fall through to legacy behavior.
- Haiku checkpoint cross-check agent — Phase 2.

## 2.3.0 (2026-02-27)

### Token Optimization

- **Compact child IDs:** Child nodes render as `.7` instead of `P0029.7` — strips the root prefix. Saves ~5 tokens per child across all render paths (renderChildren, renderChildrenExpanded, renderEntry, formatTitlesOnly, linked entries).
- **Child dates:** Child nodes show their date (MM-DD) only when it differs from the parent entry. Same-day children omit the date entirely.
- **`update_memory` content optional:** Toggling flags no longer requires repeating the entry text. `update_memory(id='P0001', secret=true)` just works — `content` parameter is now optional in both the MCP schema and `updateNode()`.

### New Features

- **Links + obsolete on sub-nodes:** `memory_nodes` table now has `links TEXT` and `obsolete INTEGER` columns. `addLink()`, `resolveObsoleteChain()`, and `updateNode()` all support compound node IDs. Obsolete chain following works for nodes in `read()`.
- **Hot nodes:** `fetchMostReferencedNodes()` shows the top-10 most-accessed sub-nodes with breadcrumb paths in bulk reads ("Frequently Referenced Nodes" section).
- **`[*]` Active marker** (root entries only): When any entry in a prefix has `active=true`, only active entries get expansion slots — but non-active entries still show as compact titles.
- **`[s]` Secret marker** (root entries + sub-nodes): Secret entries/nodes are excluded from `export_memory`.
- **`export_memory` tool:** Text export of all non-secret entries and nodes.
- **`show_important` parameter:** Returns all favorites + top-20 most-accessed entries, bypassing session cache.
- **`focus` parameter:** Force-expand a specific entry ID in bulk reads.
- **Favorite breadcrumbs:** Expanded entries with favorited sub-nodes show `[♥ path]` lines with the breadcrumb trail.
- **Reminder hint:** Bulk reads append a tip about `[♥]`/`[-]` markers and `/hmem-self-curate`.
- **`nodeMarkers()`:** Unified markers for sub-nodes: `[♥]`, `[!]` (obsolete), `[s]` (secret).

### Curation

- **`fix_agent_memory`:** Node branch now passes all flags (obsolete, favorite, secret) through to `updateNode()`. Content is optional — flags-only updates work without reading existing content first.
- **`read_agent_memory`:** Shows `[*]` and `[s]` markers.

---

## 2.2.1 (2026-02-26)

### New Features

- **Bulk read modes:** `discover` (newest-heavy, default for first read) and `essentials` (importance-heavy, auto-selected after context compression).
- **Session cache overhaul:** Fibonacci decay `[5,3,2,1,0]` with `suppressedIds` passed via ReadOptions. `reset_memory_cache` tool to clear the cache.
- **`[-]` Irrelevant marker** (root entries only): Hidden from bulk reads, no correction entry needed.
- **`expand` parameter:** `read_memory(id='P0029', expand=true, depth=3)` deep-dives with full node content.
- **Favorites on sub-nodes:** DB migration for `memory_nodes.favorite`. Favorited sub-nodes promote the root entry in bulk reads.
- **Link counts:** Links section shows `(+N obsolete hidden)` / `(+N irrelevant hidden)` counts.
- **`/hmem-self-curate` skill:** Systematic self-review workflow.

### Fixes

- Obsolete entries removed from default bulk read (only shown with `show_obsolete=true`).
- Access backfill: `expandedIds.has()` filter prevents overlap between newest and access slots.

---

## 2.2.0 (2026-02-25)

### New Features

- **Title system:** `title` column in both `memories` and `memory_nodes` tables. Auto-extracted with word-boundary truncation (`maxTitleChars: 50`). Explicit titles via first line of content.
- **`titles_only` parameter:** Compact table-of-contents view — ID + date + title per entry.
- **Time-weighted access scoring:** `access_count / age_in_hours` for smarter expansion in bulk reads.
- **Token counter:** `estimate/count/format` for output size awareness.

### Breaking Changes

- `bump_memory` tool removed (replaced by automatic access tracking).
- V1 bulk-read algorithm (`recentDepthTiers`) removed entirely.

### Cleanup

- ~538 lines of dead code removed.
- `hmem-save` moved from npm package to user-config skill.
- `maxTitleChars` default: 30 → 50.

---

## 2.1.0 (2026-02-24)

### Changes

- Period parameter `"4h"` is now symmetric (±Nh) when no sign prefix is used.
- `[♥]` `[★]` markers visible in non-curator output.
- `bump_memory` tool removed.
- V1 bulk-read (`recentDepthTiers`) removed.
- Skills cleanup: `hmem-config` + `hmem-setup` consolidated.
- CLAUDE.md updated: F-prefix → H/R/N prefixes.

---

## 2.0.0 (2026-02-24)

### Breaking Changes

- **V2 Bulk-Read is now default.** `read_memory()` returns grouped output by prefix category instead of flat chronological listing. The old V1 algorithm is still available when `recentDepthTiers` is explicitly passed.
- **Obsolete enforcement:** Marking an entry obsolete (`obsolete=true`) now requires a `[✓ID]` correction reference in the content (e.g. `"see [✓E0076]"`). The system rejects the call without it. Curator tools (`fix_agent_memory`) bypass this requirement.
- **Abstract header entries (X0000):** Each prefix category now has an auto-created header entry with `seq=0` (e.g. `P0000`, `L0000`). These are used as group headers in bulk reads and are hidden from normal queries via `seq > 0` filters.

### New Features

- **Grouped output:** Bulk reads group entries by prefix category with human-readable headers (e.g. "Lessons learned and best practices (12 entries)").
- **Smart expansion:** Newest entries, most-accessed entries, and favorites are fully expanded (all L2 children + links shown). Other entries show only the latest child with a `[+N more → ID]` hint.
- **Obsolete filtering:** Only the top N obsolete entries (by access count, "biggest mistakes") are shown in bulk reads. The rest are hidden with a summary line. Use `show_obsolete=true` to see all.
- **Payload stripping:** Non-curator output uses compact markers: `[!]` instead of `[⚠ OBSOLETE]`, no `[♥]`/`[★]` markers.
- **`bump_memory` tool:** Manually increase an entry's access count to boost its visibility in bulk reads. Supports custom increment.
- **Bubble-up access tracking:** `append_memory` automatically bumps the parent entry's and root entry's access count.
- **Time-based search:** New `time`, `period`, and `time_around` parameters for finding entries created around a specific time or near another entry.
- **Bidirectional auto-linking:** When marking an entry obsolete with `[✓ID]`, the system automatically creates links in both directions (old ↔ new).
- **Access count transfer:** When marking obsolete with `[✓ID]`, the old entry's access count is transferred to the correction entry, and the obsolete entry is reset to 0.

### Config Additions

- `prefixDescriptions` — Human-readable descriptions for each prefix category, used as group headers.
- `bulkReadV2.topAccessCount` (default: 3) — Number of most-accessed entries to expand.
- `bulkReadV2.topNewestCount` (default: 5) — Number of newest entries to expand.
- `bulkReadV2.topObsoleteCount` (default: 3) — Number of obsolete entries to keep visible.

### Security

- **SQL hardening (standalone):** `buildRoleFilter()` now uses parameterized queries instead of string interpolation.
- **WAL checkpoint:** `close()` now runs `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` for clean shutdown.

### Skills Updated

- `hmem-read` — Documents grouped output, time search, bump_memory, show_obsolete.
- `hmem-write` — Documents `[✓ID]` obsolete workflow, bump_memory, bubble-up.
- `hmem-curate` — Documents curator bypass, V2 output format, access count transfer.
- `hmem-config` — Documents new `prefixDescriptions` and `bulkReadV2` parameters.
- `hmem-save` — Updated prefix list (F removed, N added).
